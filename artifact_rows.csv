Metaphysics is the branch of philosophy that examines the basic structure of reality. It is traditionally seen as the study of mind-independent features of the world, but some theorists view it as an inquiry into the conceptual framework of human understanding. Some philosophers, including Aristotle, designate metaphysics as first philosophy to suggest that it is more fundamental than other forms of philosophical inquiry.
Metaphysics encompasses a wide range of general and abstract topics. It investigates the nature of existence, the features all entities have in common, and their division into categories of being. An influential division is between particulars and universals. Particulars are individual unique entities, like a specific apple. Universals are general features that different particulars have in common, like the color red. Modal metaphysics examines what it means for something to be possible or necessary. Metaphysicians also explore the concepts of space, time, and change, and their connection to causality and the laws of nature. Other topics include how mind and matter are related, whether everything in the world is predetermined, and whether there is free will.
Metaphysicians use various methods to conduct their inquiry. They typically rely on rational intuitions and abstract reasoning but also include empirical approaches associated with scientific theories. Due to the abstract nature of its topic, metaphysics has received criticisms questioning the reliability of its methods and the meaningfulness of its theories. Metaphysics is relevant to many fields of inquiry that often implicitly rely on metaphysical concepts and assumptions.
The roots of metaphysics lie in antiquity with speculations about the nature and origin of the universe, like those found in the Upanishads in ancient India, Taoism in ancient China, and pre-Socratic philosophy in ancient Greece. During the subsequent medieval period in the West, discussions about the nature of universals were influenced by the philosophies of Plato and Aristotle. The modern period saw the emergence of various comprehensive systems of metaphysics, many of which embraced idealism. In the 20th century, traditional metaphysics in general and idealism in particular faced various criticisms, which prompted new approaches to metaphysical inquiry.



Metaphysics is the study of the most elementary features of reality, including existence, objects and their properties, possibility and necessity, space and time, change, causation, and the relation between matter and mind. It is one of the oldest branches of philosophy.[1][a]
The precise nature of metaphysics is disputed and its characterization has changed in the course of history. Some approaches see metaphysics as a unified field and give a wide-sweeping definition by understanding it as the study of ""fundamental questions about the nature of reality"" or as an inquiry into the essences of things. Another approach doubts that the different areas of metaphysics share a set of underlying features and provides instead a fine-grained characterization by listing all the main topics investigated by metaphysicians.[4] Some definitions are descriptive by providing an account of what metaphysicians do while others are normative and prescribe what metaphysicians ought to do.[5]
Two historically influential definitions in ancient and medieval philosophy understand metaphysics as the science of the first causes and as the study of being qua being, that is, the topic of what all beings have in common and to what fundamental categories they belong. In the modern period, the scope of metaphysics expanded to include topics such as the distinction between mind and body and free will.[6] Some philosophers follow Aristotle in describing metaphysics as ""first philosophy"", suggesting that it is the most basic inquiry upon which all other branches of philosophy depend in some way.[7][b]

Immanuel Kant conceived metaphysics from the perspective of critical philosophy as the study of the principles underlying all human thought and experience.
Metaphysics is traditionally understood as a study of mind-independent features of reality. Starting with Immanuel Kant's critical philosophy, an alternative conception gained prominence that focuses on conceptual schemes rather than external reality. Kant distinguishes transcendent metaphysics, which aims to describe the objective features of reality beyond sense experience, from the critical perspective on metaphysics, which outlines the aspects and principles underlying all human thought and experience.[9] Philosopher P. F. Strawson further explored the role of conceptual schemes, contrasting descriptive metaphysics, which articulates conceptual schemes commonly used to understand the world, with revisionary metaphysics, which aims to produce better conceptual schemes.[10]
Metaphysics differs from the individual sciences by studying the most general and abstract aspects of reality. The individual sciences, by contrast, examine more specific and concrete features and restrict themselves to certain classes of entities, such as the focus on physical things in physics, living entities in biology, and cultures in anthropology.[11] It is disputed to what extent this contrast is a strict dichotomy rather than a gradual continuum.[12]


The word metaphysics has its origin in the ancient Greek words metá (μετά, meaning 'after', 'above', and 'beyond') and phusiká (φυσικά), as a short form of ta metá ta phusiká, meaning 'what comes after the physics'. This is often interpreted to mean that metaphysics discusses topics that, due to their generality and comprehensiveness, lie beyond the realm of physics and its focus on empirical observation.[13] 
Alternatively, metaphysics may have received its name by a historical accident when Aristotle's book on this subject, Metaphysics, was published.[14] Aristotle himself did not use the term metaphysics but an editor of his works some two centuries later (likely Andronicus of Rhodes) coined it for the title, presumably to indicate that this book should be studied after Aristotle's book Physics: thus, literally 'after physics'. The term entered the English language in the mid 1500s through the Latin word metaphysica.[13]


The nature of metaphysics can also be characterized in relation to its main branches. An influential division from early modern philosophy distinguishes between general and special or specific metaphysics.[15] General metaphysics, also called ontology,[c] takes the widest perspective and studies the most fundamental aspects of being. It investigates the features that all entities share and how entities can be divided into different categories. Categories are the most general kinds, such as substance, property, relation, and fact.[17] Ontologists research which categories there are, how they depend on one another, and how they form a system of categories that provides a comprehensive classification of all entities.[18]
Special metaphysics considers being from more narrow perspectives and is divided into subdisciplines based on the perspective they take. Metaphysical cosmology examines changeable things and investigates how they are connected to form a world as a totality extending through space and time.[19] Rational psychology focuses on metaphysical foundations and problems concerning the mind, such as its relation to matter and the freedom of the will. Natural theology studies the divine and its role as the first cause.[19] The scope of special metaphysics overlaps with other philosophical disciplines, making it unclear whether a topic belongs to it or to areas like philosophy of mind and theology.[20]
Starting in the second half of the 20th century, applied metaphysics was conceived as the area of applied philosophy examining the implications and uses of metaphysics, both within philosophy and other fields of inquiry. In areas like ethics and philosophy of religion, it addresses topics like the ontological foundations of moral claims and religious doctrines.[21] Beyond philosophy, its applications include the use of ontologies in artificial intelligence, economics, and sociology to classify entities.[22] In psychiatry and medicine, it examines the metaphysical status of diseases.[23]

Meta-metaphysics[d] is the metatheory of metaphysics and investigates the nature and methods of metaphysics. It examines how metaphysics differs from other philosophical and scientific disciplines and assesses its relevance to them. Even though discussions of these topics have a long history in metaphysics, meta-metaphysics has only recently developed into a systematic field of inquiry.[25]


Existence and categories of being[edit]

Metaphysicians often regard existence or being as one of the most basic and general concepts.[26] To exist means to be part of reality, distinguishing real entities from imaginary ones.[27] According to a traditionally influential view, existence is a property of properties: if an entity exists then its properties are instantiated.[28] A different position states that existence is a property of individuals, meaning that it is similar to other properties, such as shape or size.[29] It is controversial whether all entities have this property. According to philosopher Alexius Meinong, there are nonexistent objects, including merely possible objects like Santa Claus and Pegasus.[30][e] A related question is whether existence is the same for all entities or whether there are different modes or degrees of existence.[31] For instance, Plato held that Platonic forms, which are perfect and immutable ideas, have a higher degree of existence than matter, which can only imperfectly reflect Platonic forms.[32][f]
Another key concern in metaphysics is the division of entities into distinct groups based on underlying features they share. Theories of categories provide a system of the most fundamental kinds or the highest genera of being by establishing a comprehensive inventory of everything.[34] One of the earliest theories of

Free will is generally understood as the capacity or ability of people to (a) choose between different possible courses of action,[1] (b) exercise control over their actions in a way that is necessary for moral responsibility, or (c) be the ultimate source or originator of their actions.[2][3][4] There are different theories as to its nature, and these aspects are often emphasized differently depending on philosophical tradition, with debates focusing on whether and how such freedom can coexist with physical determinism, divine foreknowledge, and other constraints.
Free will is closely linked to the concepts of moral responsibility and moral desert, praise, culpability, and other judgements that can logically apply only to actions that are freely chosen. It is also connected with the concepts of advice, persuasion, deliberation, and prohibition. Traditionally, only actions that are freely willed are seen as deserving credit or blame. Whether free will exists and the implications of whether it exists or not constitute some of the longest-running debates of philosophy.
Some philosophers and thinkers conceive of free will as the capacity to make choices undetermined by past events. However, determinism suggests that the natural world is governed by cause-and-effect relationships, and only one course of events is possible, which is inconsistent with a libertarian model of free will.[5] Ancient Greek philosophy identified this issue,[6] which remains a major focus of philosophical debate to this day. The view that posits free will as incompatible with determinism is called incompatibilism and encompasses both metaphysical libertarianism (the claim that determinism is false and thus free will is at least possible) and hard determinism or hard incompatibilism (the claim that determinism is true and thus free will is not possible). Another incompatibilist position is illusionism or hard incompatibilism, which holds not only determinism but also indeterminism (randomness) to be incompatible with free will and thus free will to be impossible regardless of the metaphysical truth of determinism.
In contrast, compatibilists hold that free will is compatible with determinism. Some compatibilist philosophers (i.e., hard compatibilists) even hold that determinism is actually necessary for the existence of free will and agency, on the grounds that choice involves preference for one course of action over another, requiring a sense of how choices will turn out.[7][8] In modern philosophy, compatibilists make up the majority of thinkers, and compatibilists generally consider the debate between libertarians and hard determinists over free will vs. determinism a false dilemma.[9] Different compatibilists offer very different definitions of what ""free will"" means and consequently find different types of constraints to be relevant to the issue. Classical compatibilists considered free will nothing more than freedom of action, considering one free of will simply if, had one counterfactually wanted to do otherwise, one could have done otherwise without physical impediment. Many contemporary compatibilists instead identify free will as a psychological capacity, such as to direct one's behavior in a way that is responsive to reason or potentially sanctionable. There are still further different conceptions of free will, each with their own concerns, sharing only the common feature of not finding the possibility of physical determinism a threat to the possibility of free will.[10]


History of free will[edit]
The problem of free will has been identified in ancient Greek philosophical literature. The notion of compatibilist free will has been attributed to both Aristotle (4th century BCE) and Epictetus (1st century CE): ""it was the fact that nothing hindered us from doing or choosing something that made us have control over them"".[6][11] According to Susanne Bobzien, the notion of incompatibilist free will is perhaps first identified in the works of Alexander of Aphrodisias (3rd century CE): ""what makes us have control over things is the fact that we are causally undetermined in our decision and thus can freely decide between doing/choosing or not doing/choosing them"".
The term ""free will"" (liberum arbitrium) was introduced by Christian philosophy (4th century CE). It has traditionally meant (until the Enlightenment proposed its own meanings) lack of necessity in human will,[12] so that ""the will is free"" meant ""the will does not have to be such as it is"". This requirement was universally embraced by both incompatibilists and compatibilists.[13]



The underlying questions are whether we possess the control over our actions we feel we have, and if so, what sort or amount of control do we exercise over our voluntary behavior. These ancient philosophical problems predate the early Greek stoics (for example, Chrysippus), and some modern philosophers still lament the lack of progress over all these centuries.[14][15]
On one hand, humans have a strong sense of freedom, agency, and self-determination, which leads to a natural belief in free will and a sense of self.[16][17] On the other hand, an intuitive feeling of free will could be mistaken.[18][19]
It is difficult to reconcile the intuitive evidence that conscious decisions are causally effective with the view that the physical world can be explained entirely by physical law.[20] The conflict between intuitively felt freedom and natural law arises when either causal closure or physical determinism (nomological determinism) is asserted. With causal closure, no physical event has a cause outside the physical domain, and with physical determinism, the future is determined entirely by preceding events (cause and effect).
The puzzle of reconciling 'free will' with a deterministic universe is known as the problem of free will or sometimes referred to as the dilemma of determinism.[21] This dilemma leads to a moral dilemma as well: the question of how to assign responsibility for actions if they are caused entirely by past events.[22][23]
Compatibilists maintain that mental reality is not of itself causally effective.[24][25] Classical compatibilists have addressed the dilemma of free will by arguing that free will holds as long as humans are not externally constrained or coerced.[26] Modern compatibilists make a distinction between freedom of will and freedom of action, that is, separating freedom of choice from the freedom to enact it.[27] Given that humans all experience a sense of free will, some modern compatibilists think it is necessary to accommodate this intuition.[28][29] Compatibilists often associate freedom of will with the ability to make rational decisions.
A different approach to the dilemma is that of incompatibilists, namely, that if the world is deterministic, then our feeling that we are free to choose an action is simply an illusion. Metaphysical libertarianism is the form of incompatibilism which posits that determinism is false and free will is possible (at least some people have free will).[30] This view is associated with non-materialist constructions,[18] including both traditional dualism, as well as models supporting more minimal criteria; such as the ability to consciously veto an action or competing desire.[31][32] Yet even with physical indeterminism, arguments have been made against libertarianism in that it is difficult to assign Origination (responsibility for ""free"" indeterministic choices).
Free will here is predominantly treated with respect to physical determinism in the strict sense of nomological determinism, although other forms of determinism are also relevant to free will.[33] For example, logical and theological determinism challenge metaphysical libertarianism with ideas of destiny and fate, and biological, cultural and psychological determinism feed the development of compatibilist models. Separate classes of compatibilism and incompatibilism may even be formed to represent these.[34]
Below are the classic arguments bearing upon the dilemma and its underpinnings.



Incompatibilism is the position that free will and determinism are logically incompatible, and that the major question regarding whether or not people have free will is thus whether or not their actions are determined. ""Hard determinists"", such as d'Holbach, are those incompatibilists who accept determinism and reject free will. In contrast, ""metaphysical libertarians"", such as Thomas Reid, Peter van Inwagen, and Robert Kane, are those incompatibilists who accept free will and deny determinism, holding the view that some form of indeterminism is true.[35] Another view is that of ""hard incompatibilists"", who hold that free will is incompatible with both determinism and indeterminism.[36]
Traditional arguments for incompatibilism are based on an ""intuition pump"": if a person is like other mechanical things that are determined in their behavior such as a wind-up toy, a billiard ball, a puppet, or a robot, then people must not have free will.[35][37] This argument has been rejected by compatibilists such as Daniel Dennett on the grounds that, even if humans have something in common with these things, it remains possible and plausible that we are different from such objects in important ways.[38]
Another argument for incompatibilism is that of the ""causal chain"". Incompatibilism is key to the idealist theory of free will. Most incompatibilists reject the idea that freedom of action consists simply in ""voluntary"" behavior. They insist, rather, that to have free will, an agent must be the ""ultimate"" or ""originating"" cause of their actions. They must be causa sui, in the traditional phrase. Being responsible for one's choices is the first cause of those choices, where first cause means that there is no antecedent cause of that cause. The argument, then, is that if a person has free will, then they are the ultimate cause of their actions. If determinism is true, then all of a person's choices are caused by events and facts outside their control.

Causality is an influence by which one event, process, state, or subject (i.e., a cause) contributes to the production of another event, process, state, or object (i.e., an effect) where the cause is at least partly responsible for the effect, and the effect is at least partly dependent on the cause.[1] The cause of something may also be described as the reason behind the event or process.[2]
In general, a process can have multiple causes,[1] which are also said to be causal factors for it, and all lie in its past. An effect can in turn be a cause of, or causal factor for, many other effects, which all lie in its future. Thus, the distinction between cause and effect either follows from or else provides the distinction between past and future. While the former viewpoint is more prevalent in physics,[3] some writers have held that causality is metaphysically prior to notions of time and space.[4][5][6] Causality is an abstraction that indicates how the world progresses.[7] As such, it is a basic concept, and one might expect it to be more apt as an explanation of other concepts of progression than something to be explained by yet more fundamental ideas. The concept is like those of agency and efficacy. For this reason, a leap of intuition may be needed to grasp it.[8][9] Accordingly, causality is implicit in the structure of ordinary language,[10] as well as explicit in the language of scientific causal notation.
In English studies of Aristotelian philosophy, the word ""cause"" is used as a specialized technical term, the translation of Aristotle's term αἰτία, by which Aristotle meant ""explanation"" or ""answer to a 'why' question"". Aristotle categorized the four types of answers as material, formal, efficient, and final ""causes"". In this case, the ""cause"" is the explanans for the explanandum, and failure to recognize that different kinds of ""cause"" are being considered can lead to futile debate. Of Aristotle's four explanatory modes, the one nearest to the concerns of the present article is the ""efficient"" one.
David Hume, as part of his opposition to rationalism, argued that pure reason alone cannot prove the reality of efficient causality; instead, he appealed to custom and mental habit, observing that all human knowledge derives solely from experience.
The topic of causality remains a staple in contemporary philosophy.




The nature of cause and effect is a concern of the subject known as metaphysics. Kant thought that time and space were notions prior to human understanding of the progress or evolution of the world, and he also recognized the priority of causality. But he did not have the understanding that came with knowledge of Minkowski geometry and the special theory of relativity, that the notion of causality can be used as a prior foundation from which to construct notions of time and space.[4][5][6]


A general metaphysical question about cause and effect is: ""what kind of entity can be a cause, and what kind of entity can be an effect?""
One viewpoint on this question is that cause and effect are of one and the same kind of entity, causality being an asymmetric relation between them. That is to say, it would make good sense grammatically to say either ""A is the cause and B the effect"" or ""B is the cause and A the effect"", though only one of those two can be actually true. In this view, one opinion, proposed as a metaphysical principle in process philosophy, is that every cause and every effect is respectively some process, event, becoming, or happening.[5] An example is 'his tripping over the step was the cause, and his breaking his ankle the effect'. Another view is that causes and effects are 'states of affairs', with the exact natures of those entities being more loosely defined than in process philosophy.[11]
Another viewpoint on this question is the more classical one, that a cause and its effect can be of different kinds of entity. For example, in Aristotle's efficient causal explanation, an action can be a cause while an enduring object is its effect. For example, the generative actions of his parents can be regarded as the efficient cause, with Socrates being the effect, Socrates being regarded as an enduring object, in philosophical tradition called a 'substance', as distinct from an action.


Since causality is a subtle metaphysical notion, considerable intellectual effort, along with exhibition of evidence, is needed to establish knowledge of it in particular empirical circumstances. According to David Hume, the human mind is unable to perceive causal relations directly. On this ground, the scholar distinguished between the regularity view of causality and the counterfactual notion.[12] According to the counterfactual view, X causes Y if and only if, without X, Y would not exist. Hume interpreted the latter as an ontological view, i.e., as a description of the nature of causality; but, given the limitations of the human mind, advised using the former (stating, roughly, that X causes Y if and only if the two events are spatiotemporally conjoined, and X precedes Y) as an epistemic definition of causality. We need an epistemic concept of causality in order to distinguish between causal and noncausal relations. The contemporary philosophical literature on causality can be divided into five major approaches to causality. These include the (mentioned above) regularity, probabilistic, counterfactual, mechanistic, and manipulationist views. The five approaches can be shown to be reductive, i.e., they define causality in terms of relations of other types.[13] According to this reading, they define causality in terms of, respectively, empirical regularities (constant conjunctions of events), changes in conditional probabilities, counterfactual conditions, mechanisms underlying causal relations, and invariance under intervention.

Geometrical significance[edit]
Causality has the properties of antecedence and contiguity.[14][15] These are topological, and are ingredients for space-time geometry. As developed by Alfred Robb, these properties allow the derivation of the notions of time and space.[16] Max Jammer writes ""the Einstein postulate ... opens the way to a straightforward construction of the causal topology ... of Minkowski space.""[17] Causal efficacy propagates no faster than light.[18]
Thus, the notion of causality is metaphysically prior to the notions of time and space. In practical terms, this is because use of the relation of causality is necessary for the interpretation of empirical experiments. Interpretation of experiments is needed to establish the physical and geometrical notions of time and space.


The deterministic world-view holds that the history of the universe can be exhaustively represented as a progression of events following one after the other as cause and effect.[15] Incompatibilism holds that determinism is incompatible with free will, so if determinism is true, ""free will"" does not exist. Compatibilism, on the other hand, holds that determinism is compatible with, or even necessary for, free will.[19]

Necessary and sufficient causes[edit]

Causes may sometimes be distinguished into two types: necessary and sufficient.[20] A third type of causation, which requires neither necessity nor sufficiency, but which contributes to the effect, is called a ""contributory cause"".

Necessary causes
If x is a necessary cause of y, then the presence of y necessarily implies the prior occurrence of x. The presence of x, however, does not imply that y will occur.[21]
Sufficient causes
If x is a sufficient cause of y, then the presence of x necessarily implies the subsequent occurrence of y. However, another cause z may alternatively cause y. Thus the presence of y does not imply the prior occurrence of x.[21]
Contributory causes
For some specific effect, in a singular case, a factor that is a contributory cause is one among several co-occurrent causes. It is implicit that all of them are contributory. For the specific effect, in general, there is no implication that a contributory cause is necessary, though it may be so. In general, a factor that is a contributory cause is not sufficient, because it is by definition accompanied by other causes, which would not count as causes if it were sufficient. For the specific effect, a factor that is on some occasions a contributory cause might on some other occasions be sufficient, but on those other occasions it would not be merely contributory.[22]
J. L. Mackie argues that usual talk of ""cause"" in fact refers to INUS conditions (insufficient but non-redundant parts of a condition which is itself unnecessary but sufficient for the occurrence of the effect).[23] An example is a short circuit as a cause for a house burning down. Consider the collection of events: the short circuit, the proximity of flammable material, and the absence of firefighters. Together these are unnecessary but sufficient to the house's burning down (since many other collections of events certainly could have led to the house burning down, for example shooting the house with a flamethrower in the presence of oxygen and so forth). Within this collection, the short circuit is an insufficient (since the short circuit by itself would not have caused the fire) but non-redundant (because the fire would not have happened without it, everything else being equal) part of a condition which is itself unnecessary but sufficient for the occurrence of the effect. So, the short circuit is an INUS condition for the occurrence of the house burning down. 
However, Mackie's INUS account succumbs to the problem of joint effects of a common cause: it incorrectly identifies one effect of a common cause as an instantiated INUS condition for another effect of the same common cause, even though the two effects are not causally related.[24] Modern regularity theories aim to overcome this problem using so-called non-redundant regularities.[25][26]

Contrasted with conditionals[edit]

Conditional statements are not statements of causality.

    Metaphysics seems to be a field that is almost purely abstract. However, I am also interested in knowing how metaphysics has impacted the real world, if at all.

See Hawley's paper Applied Metaphysics for a recent survey. She gives three application areas outside of philosophy: applied ontology in computer science and biology, social ontology, and metaphysics of natural kind terms in psychiatry and medicine. Modal metaphysics of natural kinds is also prominent in the causal theory of reference in linguistics developed by Kripke and Putnam. One more area is high energy physics, where various grand unification projects require careful inspection of metaphysical aspects of their hypothetical fundamental ontologies, see e.g. On the Emergence of Time in Quantum Gravity by Isham and Butterfield (section 4). 

The first international workshop on applied ontology was held in 1993, Applied Ontology journal was founded in 2005, and Journal of Social Ontology in 2014, both are backed by international societies. Note that the use of terms ""metaphysics"" and ""ontology"" in applied contexts is controversial, some scientists wish to draw a sharp distinction between applied and philosophical meaning of the words, others embrace their unity. E.g. Smith and Klagges write ""Applied ontology is a branch of applied philosophy using philosophical ideas and methods from ontology in order to contribute to a more adequate presentation of the results of scientific research"". Regardless of linguistic preferences there is one common feature the two share, a prominent role of metaphysical speculation in constructing suitable frameworks for a domain of discourse, some call it ""ontological engineering"". Another shared function is serving as an incubator of new scientific theories, which generates hypotheses that can then be empirically tested.

Guarino and Musen explain that ""linguists and philosophers now work hand-in-hand with traditional computer scientists to build complex information systems with explicit, examinable conceptual models of the environments in which they are intended to operate, of the organizations in which they will be used, and of the data and knowledge that they will process"". Even existentialist ontologies of Heidegger and Merleau-Ponty found unexpected applications in AI research, see Dreyfus's Why Heideggerian AI Failed and how Fixing it would Require making it more Heideggerian. Gene ontologies embed gene products into a web populated by biological processes, cellular components and molecular functions in a way that is not species specific, and so it does not reflect the usual ontology. 

The natural kinds feature for instance in metaphysical ontologies of diseases or mental disorders, this is ethically sensitive and potentially controversial:""If we take the example of chemical elements as paradigmatic, we may think of natural kinds as determining the intrinsic, essential features of the world, and as drawing sharp, immutable boundaries between different kinds of people"". Hawley's own characterization of social ontology is as follows:""Social ontologists study the nature of social reality, for example social groups, institutions, markets, rules, collective act ions, and a myriad other social phenomena.  What is the relationship between a group’s action and structure, and the individual actions of group members? What is it for individuals to act jointly?  What is it for an institution to structure behaviour?""

Everything we do has metaphysical origins.
What we call physical or natural science has failed to establish any mechanism of consciousness, choice, or conscience, and yet these are self-evident. Everyone experiences them, but physics does not explain them.

The motive power behind every discovery, every breath, and every action is a forward-looking, metaphysical expectation and reliance on the realization of things not yet realized. Imagination, desire, volition, movement, and life itself are all witnesses of the metaphysical; while they obey natural laws, they are neither described fully nor circumscribed by any known set of purely physical laws. Some would call this phenomenon faith: the expectation of things not (yet) seen. Many others might not have a name for it. Some would describe it as strictly rational, but I am not aware of any rational defense for this argument. This pattern of self-motive action to materialize hitherto unseen outcomes is common to all life.

Whatever your belief on the subject, belief itself is a further manifestation of the metaphysical, inclining you to act in certain ways in preference to others.
In short, it would be difficult or impossible to name anything that has not in some way been affected by the metaphysical.

Conifold's answer is very thorough, but I believe it answers only one of the two questions you have asked. 
The first question and the one to which Conifold responds is:


  What are some real-life applications of metaphysics?


The second, more interesting and thus far neglected question is:


  How has metaphysics impacted the real-world, if at all?


The difference between these two questions becomes clear if we consider another example. An enumeration of the 'real-world applications' of music might include prenatal music therapy, whereas the impact of music on the world is so much broader than any single 'application' that it would indeed be difficult to understate.

The mathematician and philosopher C.S. Peirce has this to say about the impact of metaphysics on the world and the hope he has for his own:


  To erect a philosophical edifice that shall outlast the vicissitudes of time, my care must be, not so much to set each brick with nicest accuracy, as to lay the foundations deep and massive. Aristotle builded upon a few deliberately chosen concepts - such as matter and form, act and power -- very broad, and in their outlines vague and rough, but solid, unshakable, and not easily undermined; and thence it has come to pass that Aristotelianism is babbeld in every nursery, that ""English Common Sense"", for example, is thoroughly peripatetic, and that ordinary men live so completely within the house of the Stagyrite that whatever they see out of the windows appears to them comprehensible and metaphysical. Long it has been only too manifest that, fondly habituated though we are to it, the old structure will not do for modern needs; and accordingly, under Descartes, Hobbes, Kant, and others, repairs, alterations and partial demolitions have been carried on for the last three centuries. [...] The undertaking of this present work [of metaphysics] is to outline a theory so comprehensive that, for a long time to come, the entire work of human reason, in philosophy of every school and kind, in mathematics, in psychology, in physical science, in history, in sociology,  and in whatever department there may be, shall appear as the filling up of its details.

Professional software developer here, and I can offer you an example from my own experience.  The reigning software development paradigm since about 1980 has been ""object-oriented programming"".  The idea being that one uses code to describe a type (or ""class""), its states, and possible behaviors, then creates an instance (""object"") of that class for actual use.  Classes can also be extended to create sub-classes (e.g., Square is a sub-class of Rectangle, with additional behavioral constraints).

In my opinion, one thing that often separates a good programmer from a great programmer is the ability to reason about ontology in this environment.  Adding behavior to classes that should not ontologically contain that behavior makes software very difficult to manage as a system grows in size and complexity.  This often leads to interesting metaphysical discussions, for example: ""What do we really have?  A User whose state is deleted, or do we have a new thing, a DeletedUser?""

In my experience, virtually all books on object-oriented programming begin with a discussion of the relevant metaphysical concepts, without ever mentioning (knowing?) that we're discussing philosophy and not programming.  But of course, without the philosophical underpinnings it would be impossible to begin programming in any object-oriented language.
